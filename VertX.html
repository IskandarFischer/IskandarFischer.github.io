By being introduced to the Hololens early in it’s development, I’ve managed to develop a good problem solving mindset as a lot of documentation was outdated and required playing around, debugging and figuring out the best way to tackle a problem. In addition, the fact that the Hololens was so new, it required a very different mindset from what I was used to. Not only did I have to think outside the box and very creatively, I had to apply mathematical knowledge to another dimension due to the Hololens having to move object through hand movement. <br/><br/>
								The experience gained through was incredibly valuable and rewarding on a daily basis due to the amount of feature being developed in very short periods of time. I also got exposed to a lot of software engineering principles and solidified Task Management tools and subversion tools. <br/><br/>
								Early in the development of VertX I worked on several aspect specifically the organizing of items and creating movement, scaling and rotation behaviours for it. I also aided in the new way of interaction through a radial menu, something that Hololens developer weren’t keen on the idea, but after using it themselves they saw the potential and the benefit of using a radial menu in the Hololens. The first few feature truly challenged me, as it was firstly a very different environment from academia and provided me with far more knowledge and challenges then academia did. <br/><br/>
								Once VertX picked up heavy traction in the company, I had to opportunity to participate in the development of an application which would allow users of various VR, AR and non to be able to visualize the same scene and work on it in real time by leveraging cloud architectures. The project consisted of getting data from the cloud which contained data pertaining to items that are currently present in the scene. While achieving this, I also developed several new solutions for Translation and Scaling to better fit the new idea of the application and also to provide a possible improvement to the ways of interacting with objects.<br/><br/>
								While a lot of my work consisted of improvement interaction solutions in the Hololens, I also had opportunities to work on a object highlight shader and creating an object bounding box and binding different interaction tools to them and providing ways of deciding what type of transformation to apply to the selected object.</p>

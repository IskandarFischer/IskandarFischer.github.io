									Worked on a Point-Cloud based device where objects could be placed in real world to deliver a project to Google. One of these included a board which was a TTD game where you would place towers in the real world which would them allow the AI to travel to a destination point. All of these were done on the Google Tango phone on its release where documentation was severely lacking under a small time-frame.
									<br/><br/>
									During the implementation of the features, it was very interesting familiarizing myself with the new device and a technology which I’ve never used before, namely Point Cloud. During the project I had to dig through the methods provided by the Google Tango API and find out several Point Cloud function to be able to place the board onto a surface. This proved quite the challenge as the documentation from Google itself was severely lacking at the time.
									<br/><br/>
									The project took a lot of assets from Botanika, however due to several issues, all of the functionalities couldn’t be ported over, and therefore I took a lot of time rewriting the features to be able to be compatible with the application, with a few notable script making their way towards the main game.
									<br/><br/>
									Another difficulty with the project, was allowing the AI to move around the terrain, the AI had severe issue with the meshes provided and a lot of the time wouldn’t move or take very inefficient path, in addition to playable object this proved to be quite a task to find a solution for, however after tinkering and providing edits to models and collisions a solution was found.
									<br/><br/>
									Not only did I learn a lot about various aspect of VR through the Google Tango, I also learnt a lot about mobile development and Android Studio. I’ve  learnt how to deal with the graphical or CPU bottlenecks that can arise and solved the ones that were possible on the programming end to ensure high FPS on the device.
